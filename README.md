- **Mock Servers**: Life-like mock servers from any API Specification Document.
- **Validation Proxy**: Contract Testing for API Consumers and Developers.
- **Comprehensive API Specification Support**: OpenAPI 3.0, OpenAPI 2.0 (FKA Swagger) and Postman Collections support.

> Note: This branch refers to Prism 3.x, which is the current version most likely you will use. If you're looking for the 2.x version, look at the [`2.x` branch][2.x]

## üß∞ Install and Use

**Installation**
```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli

# OR

yarn global add @stoplight/prism-cli
```
> Prism requires NodeJS >= 12 to properly work.

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Cannot access mock server when using docker?**

Prism uses localhost by default, which usually means 127.0.0.1. When using docker the mock server will
be unreachable outside of the container unless you run the mock command with `-h 0.0.0.0`.

**Why am I getting 404 errors when I include my basePath?**

OpenAPI v2.0 had a concept called "basePath", which was essentially part of the HTTP path the stuff
after host name and protocol, and before query string. Unlike the paths in your `paths` object, this
basePath was applied to every single URL, so Prism v2.x used to do the same. In OpenAPI v3.0 they
merged the basePath concept in with the server.url, and Prism v3 has done the same.

We treat OAS2 `host + basePath` the same as OAS3 `server.url`, so we do not require them to go in
the URL. If you have a base path of `api/v1` and your path is defined as `hello`, then a request to
`http://localhost:4010/hello` would work, but `http://localhost:4010/api/v1/hello` will fail. This
confuses some, but the other way was confusing to others. Check the default output of Prism CLI to
see what URLs you have available.

**Is there a hosted version of Prism?**

Yes, hosted mocking is available as part of Stoplight Platform. [Learn More](https://stoplight.io/api-mocking?utm_source=github&utm_medium=prism&utm_campaign=readme)
